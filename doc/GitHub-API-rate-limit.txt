----------------------------------------------------------------
https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting :

 For requests using Basic Authentication or OAuth, you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour. 
 For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 60 requests per hour. 
 Unauthenticated requests are associated with your IP address, and not the user making requests. 
 Note that the Search API has custom rate limit rules.

 You can check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status:
   curl -i https://api.github.com/users/whatever
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2013 17:27:06 GMT
   Status: 200 OK
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
 
   - X-RateLimit-Limit	    The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour.
   - X-RateLimit-Remaining	The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
   - X-RateLimit-Reset	    The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.
  
 Once you go over the rate limit you will receive an error response:
 
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:50:41 GMT
   Status: 403 Forbidden
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1377013266
